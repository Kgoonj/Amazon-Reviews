# 🛒 Amazon Reviews Sentiment Analysis

This project contains a Jupyter Notebook for performing sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews. The analysis includes data preprocessing, visualization, and applying machine learning models to classify reviews as positive or negative.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this notebook is to analyze Amazon reviews and predict sentiment using various techniques in natural language processing and machine learning. It demonstrates the full pipeline from raw text to prediction and evaluation.

## 📊 Features

- Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal)
- Exploratory data analysis and visualizations
- Vectorization using TF-IDF or CountVectorizer
- Sentiment classification using ML models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes)
- Model evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the notebook locally:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AmazonReviews.git
cd AmazonReviews
2. Install dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3.7+ and install the required libraries:

Note: Run nltk.download('stopwords') and other required datasets inside the notebook.

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook
bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook AmazonReviews.ipynb
🧠 Models Used
Logistic Regression

Naive Bayes

(Optional: Support Vector Machines, Random Forests)

📈 Evaluation
Models are evaluated using:
